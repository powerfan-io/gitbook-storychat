# Create Images & Videos

Storychat provides users with a flexible environment for creating images and videos. Currently, only the image generation feature is supported, with video generation to be updated soon.&#x20;

Images can be generated by pressing the Create Image & Video button in the Create tab to launch the Image Generator or during conversations with characters in Storychat.

By pressing the Create Image & Video button, the Image Generator will run, offering an environment solely for image creation, apart from the chat functionality.

You can also generate images during a conversation with a character by pressing the Image button.

Images can be easily generated by filling in the following fields. Note that all image generation consumes Story Points.



**Format**

Select the type of output you want to generate: image or video.



**Select Image Size**

Set the resolution of the image.



**Select Generation Type**

Choose the generation type. Two types are available:

* **Text to Image:** Generates an image based on a prompt.
* **Image to Image:** Generates an image by reflecting the modifications of a prompt on an uploaded image.



**Seed**

Enter a value to use as the seed. If you want to consistently feature a specific protagonist or image, enter the seed value of that image to have it reflected in newly generated images. The default value is -1, which returns a random result.



**Upload Photo**

If using the Image to Image feature, upload the image to be used as the base.



**Positive Prompt**

Enter a textual description of the image you wish to generate. The positive prompt will be reflected in the generated image.



**Negative Prompt**

Enter elements you want to exclude from the generated image. The negative prompt ensures these elements are removed from the image.

> Example: To generate an image of a girl without glasses:
>
> **Positive Prompt:** a girl
>
> **Negative Prompt:** glasses
