## What is Feed?

Feed is a place where users can effortlessly enjoy content and receive recommendations tailored to their preferences. Feed offers two types of content:

* **Story:** Text-based content similar to webtoons and web novels.
* **Short-form Video:** Short video content created by leveraging AI conversations.

Users can explore a variety of content on Storychat without any hassle, and they can follow their favorite creators or like content they enjoy. Feed provides personalized content, delivering an optimal experience tailored to each user's tastes.

## Swipe & Scroll

Feed allows users to experience a variety of content. It displays information about the creators and their content. Users can explore more content by swiping left or right (Swipe) or scrolling up and down (Scroll).

* **Swipe:** Swiping left or right changes the content to another creator's work, allowing users to discover new content.
* **Scroll:** Scrolling up or down lets users view the preceding or following parts of the current content. If users scroll again at the end of the content, they can view the next Chat in the Story.



## Chat with this Character

Users can start a conversation with a character they find interesting while browsing the Feed or if they are not satisfied with the current Story content. By setting various personas, users can create entirely different narratives within the same universe. Why not try becoming a creator yourself?

Storychat provides an environment where users can easily explore content and participate directly, experiencing the joy of creation.
