## What is Create?

Create is the space within Storychat where all AI characters are generated. With just a few taps and brief prompts, every user can create millions of diverse characters.

The Create tab supports two main functions:

## Create Character

This feature allows users to generate AI characters easily through prompt inputs. Storychat supports two different character creation modes:

* **Easy Mode**&#x20;
* **Expert Mode**

Users can create their own characters and either enjoy private conversations without sharing them with the community or design appealing and unique characters, share them with the Storychat community, and potentially earn revenue as a Chatbot Maker. More detailed instructions on character creation can be found in the [Tutorial.](../other-languages/korean.md)



## Create Group

This feature allows users to create group chats.

By creating a group, users can invite other users and AI characters to participate in AI chat within the same group.
