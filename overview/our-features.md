## Storychat's Vision

Storychat supports easy content creation through AI. Additionally, through the Feed function, creators can share their content with the community easily and effectively, with blockchain technology ensuring accurate measurement and reward of contributions.&#x20;

This blurs the line between consumers and creators, creating an environment where anyone can easily become a creator and provide diverse content. Through this, we aim to redefine the content and social media markets, rapidly expanding by providing a platform that everyone can enjoy.



## Long-term Vision

As AI rapidly advances, its utility and impact on humanity continue to grow. Storychat aims to contribute to and guide the coming AI era in a correct and fair direction.

**Open AI:** AI technology should be accessible to everyone globally. Storychat aspires to an open-source model where ecosystem participants can contribute to and use AI, rather than having AI technology and information monopolized by large corporations.

**Fair Rewards:** With the advent of blockchain, we can establish automated reward models that everyone can agree on. The growth of the platform is achieved through individual contributions, and every contribution is valuable. Storychat respects and fairly rewards all contributions from Story Makers, Chatbot Makers, IP Holders, and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). This leads to greater platform growth.

Through these principles, Storychat aims to innovate the content ecosystem in the AI era, creating a platform where everyone can participate and be fairly rewarded.
