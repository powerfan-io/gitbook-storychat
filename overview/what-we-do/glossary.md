A place to discover all types of content available on Storychat. You can browse leaderboards showcasing top-performing participants and explore stories and characters created by various creators. To facilitate better navigation, content can be sorted using hashtags, and a search function is also provided.



### Like

An action users can take in the Feed. Users can like stories, short-form videos, or characters they enjoy, which helps personalize the content recommended to them.



### Follow

Another action users can take in the Feed. While likes indicate content preference, following is for tracking content creators. This action also helps personalize content recommendations for the user.



### Subscribe

Users can subscribe to stories created by Story Makers. Subscription requires payment and provides access to new content from the Story Maker.



### Story

In Storychat, there are Stories and Chats. A Story is a higher-level concept composed of multiple Chats. Creators can combine several Chats to create a Story, similar to playlists on YouTube or titles in web novels and webtoons.



### Chat

Chats are the building blocks of Stories. Each Chat represents a scene from a conversation created by a creator. Multiple Chats can be combined to form a Story, analogous to episodes in YouTube videos, web novels, or webtoons.



### Creators

Creators are participants who generate content on Storychat. There are two types of creators: Story Makers and Chatbot Makers.



### Story Maker

A Story Maker actively engages in conversations with AI characters and uses these dialogues to create new Stories, which are then shared on the Feed. The more subscribers they have, the more revenue they can earn.



### Chatbot Maker

A Chatbot Maker creates AI characters used in conversations and Story creation. These characters can have various tones and interests defined by prompts. The more users interact with the created characters, the more revenue the Chatbot Maker can earn.



### Users

Users are general participants who consume the content created by creators. Users can be categorized into Readers and Chatters.



### Readers

Readers do not directly interact with AI characters or create AI characters but watch videos or subscribe to and enjoy stories on the Feed.



### Chatters

Chatters do not share their own content like creators, but they actively participate in conversations with AI characters, generating and enjoying images and videos.
