# Mission

Users can earn free Story Points by completing missions in the Storychat app. Missions can be accessed from the Account tab at the bottom of the app.&#x20;

There are four types of missions:

1. **Daily Check-In**
2. **Join Our Community**
3. **Referral**
4. **Achievements**&#x20;



## Daily Check-In

Daily Check-In is the simplest and most basic way to earn Story Points. Users only need to launch the Storychat app and press the Daily Check-In button.

* **Participation Conditions:** Users can participate once per day, and can re-participate after 24 hours.
* **Reward Increase:** The amount of rewards from Daily Check-In increases with consecutive check-ins. However, if a day is missed, the reward amount resets to Day 1.
* **Reward Limitation:** Users cannot receive rewards from Daily Check-In if they hold a certain amount of Story Points.

> **Policy Note:** The Daily Check-In reward policy is in its initial stage and may be subject to change according to operational guidelines.



## Join Our Community

Users can earn free Story Points by joining Storychat's community channels.

* **Reward Conditions:** Community missions offer one-time rewards and each account can participate once per channel.

## Referral

When another user signs up through an invitation link, the user who generated the link receives Story Points as a reward.

There is no limit to the number of referrals, and rewards are given for each successful referral.
