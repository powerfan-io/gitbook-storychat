# Seasonal Leaderboard

## Storychat Seasonal Operations

To encourage active participation from ecosystem participants and accurately measure their contributions, Storychat operates a seasonal reward system. Each season lasts for one month, during which anyone can check the current rankings via the leaderboard. Rewards are distributed based on the rankings at the end of the season.





## Leaderboard

The leaderboard on the Explore page allows users to check the current rankings. The leaderboard tracks the following rankings:

* **Story Maker**
* **Story**
* **Character**

Each leaderboard has a different scoring method, with the current criteria as follows:

* **Story Maker:** Based on story sales performance.
* **Story:** The total number of likes received + individual story sales performance.
* **Character:** The total number of likes received + the number of interactions with the character by all users.

Seasonal leaderboard rewards may include Story Points, GEM, $SCHAT, or a combination thereof. The type and quantity of rewards can change each season.

Storychat's seasonal operations promote user engagement through a fair and transparent reward system, fostering continuous growth of the ecosystem.
