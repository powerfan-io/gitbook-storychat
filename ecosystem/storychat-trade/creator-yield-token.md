# Creator Yield Token

## What is Creator Yield Token

The Creator Yield Token (YT) allows early fans to support Storychat creators and includes a share of the creator's equity. Each creator can have their own YT, and token holders share in a portion of the creator's total earnings.&#x20;

Earnings are paid in $APT.&#x20;

This system enables growing creators to effectively raise funds, while $SCHAT token holders can acquire a stake in promising creators through early support. Yield Tokens can be traded on Storychat Trade.

## How to Issue Creator Yield Token

While anyone can become a creator on Storychat, not all creators are eligible to issue Yield Tokens.&#x20;

Creators meeting Storychat's criteria for content quality, activity history, follower count, etc., can apply to issue Yield Tokens. Once approved by the Storychat team after a final review, a staking pool for the creator is created on Storychat Trade.



### Creator Pool Staking

Staking is the final check to confirm actual demand from users. $SCHAT token holders can stake their tokens in the Staking Pool of a creator they wish to support on Storychat Trade. If the total staked amount reaches the target, the public sale of Creator Yield Tokens begins, and anyone can purchase them using $SCHAT tokens.&#x20;

The staked $SCHAT tokens are converted into Creator Yield Tokens at a discounted price, with priority over the public sale.



## Creator Earnings Distribution

Earnings from Creator Yield Tokens are distributed in $APT, after deducting Storychat platform fees. Payments are made based on milestone achievements to ensure the creator's continued active participation.



### Summary

Creator Yield Tokens support emerging creators and offer $SCHAT token holders the opportunity to acquire stakes in promising creators. This establishes a sustainable economic system within the Storychat ecosystem, benefiting both creators and fans.
