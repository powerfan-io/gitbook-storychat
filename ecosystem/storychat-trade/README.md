Storychat Trade is an exchange and platform that enables asset trading and interactions such as staking through the $SCHAT token.



## Marketplace

The Marketplace on Storychat Trade allows users to buy and sell various assets, characters, creators' IP, and shares using $SCHAT. Supported assets for trading include:

* **Story Point**
* **Creator Yield Token**
* **Character IP**
* **AI Provider NFT**
* **etc.**



## Staking

Users can stake $SCHAT on Storychat Trade to earn additional rewards.



**Storychat Pool Staking**&#x20;

Users can stake $SCHAT in the basic Storychat Staking Pool. Holders who stake in this pool share a portion of the revenue generated from the Storychat App.&#x20;

Rewards from Storychat Pool Staking are stable and continuous, paid in $APT. The longer the staking period, the greater the rewards.



**Creator Pool**&#x20;

When a creator applies for the issuance of Yield Tokens, a dedicated pool for that creator is created on Storychat Trade. $SCHAT holders can stake in the Creator Pool, and if the total staking amount reaches the target, the staked tokens are converted into Creator Yield Tokens at a discounted price.
